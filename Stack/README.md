                        Stack
                
    What is it?
    -----------

    Stack is a data structure about which you can 
    read on the Internet. This stack is safety
    (with handling various errors which may occur
    during operation). Its functions will will not
    work in case of an error and return the code
    of the error which has occurred. Thus, errors
    can be handled during the execution of the
    program and it will not fail with an error.
    Also you can switch on the debug mode and 
    find errors effectively with the help of logs.

    The Latest Version
    ------------------

    The latest version of the program the program is 
    debugged and works fine (I think so).

    Documentation
    -------------

    You can find documentation in the header files.
    
    Installation
    ------------
    
    Install program folder, go to the directory. Open 
    the command line print 'make' on the command line
    (you need to have g++ compiler installed). Then
    print './test' and use it. To use stack in
    your project you have to include "stack.h"
    and "error_detection.h" headers to your proj and
    compile .cpp files with the g++ compiler 
    with the rest of the files in your project.
    Good luck:)
